🚗 Uber Data Analysis Dashboard


📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Uber ride data to uncover insights about booking patterns, trip distances, ride durations, and vehicle preferences.
The goal is to transform raw trip data into interactive visual dashboards using Power BI, making it easier to understand how Uber services perform across time and locations.

The dashboard is divided into three main sections:

Overview Analysis

Time Analysis

Detail Dashboard

📊 1. Overview Analysis

This section provides a complete summary of Uber rides through KPIs and visual insights.

Key Features:

Created 6 main KPIs:

Total Bookings

Total Booking Value

Average Booking Value

Total Trip Distance

Average Trip Distance

Average Trip Time

Added 3 dynamic parameters — Total Bookings, Total Trip Value, and Total Trip Distance.

Based on the selected parameter, two donut charts automatically update to display relevant insights.

Designed a Vehicle Type Analysis Matrix to compare performance across different vehicle types.

Added a Line Chart showing Total Bookings by Day to track booking trends over time.

Location Analysis:

KPIs for Most Frequent Pickup Point, Most Frequent Drop Point, and Farthest Trip.

Bar Charts to show Total Booking Value by Location and Most Preferred Vehicle Type per Location.

⏱️ 2. Time Analysis

This section focuses on analyzing Uber rides based on time trends.

Key Features:

Added a central parameter selector to dynamically change the time-based insights.

Created Line Charts for:

Total Trip Distance by Pickup Time

Total Trip Distance by Day

Added a Matrix Visualization with color formatting to show booking intensity during different times.

Designed a Bar Chart representing Total Trip Distance by Pickup Hour, highlighting the busiest hours for travel.

📋 3. Detail Dashboard

This section provides a detailed, filter-based view of all Uber rides.

Key Features:

Built a dynamic table that automatically updates based on selected filters and parameters.

Enables users to explore trip details such as pickup and drop points, distances, and time durations interactively.
